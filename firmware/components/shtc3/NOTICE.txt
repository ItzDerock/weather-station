This SHTC3 sensor driver is a derivative of the SHT3x driver found at:
  - https://github.com/pedrominatel/esp-components/

With the following changes
  - Delay after wakeup to allow the sensor to activate
  - Increased timeout for I2C read/write operations due to the sensor's use of clock stretching.
